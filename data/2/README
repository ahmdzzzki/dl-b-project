These files were generated as part of a research project in the CVUT University, Prague, Czech Republic.
The goal is to store long-lived real botnet traffic and to generate labeled netflows files.

Pcap files:
- capture20110811.pcap
It is a capture with all the traffic (background, normal and botnet)
This pcap file is not made public because it contains too much private information about the users of the network.

- botnet-capture-20110811-neris.pcap
Capture with only the botnet traffic. It is made public.

Netflow files:
- capture20110811.pcap.netflow.labeled
This file has the netflows generated by a unidirectional argus. The labels were assigned as this:
1- First put Background to all the flows.
2- Put LEGITIMATE to the flows that match some filters.
3- Put Botnet to the flows that come to or from the IP address 147.32.84.165

The filters for normal (or legitimate) traffic had the IP address of our co-workers in the lab that we are sure were not infected because we check their computers by hand.
